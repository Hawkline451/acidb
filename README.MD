# AciDB

Acidophiles are defined as organisms which can grow optimally in environments with a pH lower than 5. They are represented in Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya and are scattered in all the tree of life. The literature often doesn't provide clear information about optimal pH growth which generates a difficult step for researchers in the area to study these organisms. AciDB is a curated database of sequenced acidophilic organisms with emphasis in Bacterial and Archaeal genomes which integrates general characteristics of growth condition, genomic features and taxonomy information for more than 600 different strains from the three domains of the tree of life.
